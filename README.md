# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
In this project, I used JavaScript and HTML to build a table about UFO data. The table is fully dynamic and can be filtered using several criteria which allow users to interact with our data.

## Results
To access the webpage, click on this link: https://doriansafaa.github.io/UFOs/. The webpage consists of two parts. The first part gives some information about using UFOs and how data analysis can support sky searching for UFOs.

The second part of the webpage displays the UFO data in a dynamic table that can be filtered using multiple criteria such as date, City, country, state, and shape.

Letâ€™s try the filters and see how many UFOs were seen in Fresno. Our search result shows that on 1/1/2010 a UFO of light shape appeared in Fresno and hovered over head before it disappeared.

## Summary
This webpage is a great reosurce for people who are interested in UFO and curious to know dates and locations a specific UFO appeared. One drowback about this webpage is that it is using a static data. Therefore, the data won't be up to date to catch the latest UFO appearance. It would be useful if we can automate the data extraction using API or by web scraping.  

In addition, the date filter require people to select a specific date to search for UFO data. Sometime, people don't know an exact date and prefer to select a range of dates to catch more data. For this reason, adding "From date to date" option in the search list allow people to cover more than one date in one search.
